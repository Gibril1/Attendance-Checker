# Attendance Checker
A node with express api for marking attendance in a school

## Scope of Project
This project involves the development of an Express API for marking attendance in a primary or junior high school, where students are not allowed to use their phones. At the beginning of each academic semester, teachers create courses they will be teaching, and students register for the courses by joining them. The software is bespoke and can be used by the entire school.

## Overview
There are two types of users with different roles: students and teachers. A teacher creates a course, and students join the courses they prefer. When the teacher decides to take attendance, they log into the system and start mentioning the names of the students who have registered for their courses. This helps to foster familiarity between the teacher and their students and allows the teacher to learn the names of their students.

Additionally, the system provides analytical features for both types of users, allowing them to track their attendance record, such as the number of days they have been present or absent.
