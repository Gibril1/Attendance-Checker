# Attendance Checker
A node with express api for marking attendance in a school

## Scope of Project
An attendance marking system for a primary or junior high school where students are not allowed to use a phone. At  the beginning of every academic semester, teachers create courses they are supposed to teach and students in turn register for the course by joining the course. This system is a bespoke software that can be used by the whole school.

## Overview
In essence, there are two kinds of users that differentiated by their roles. Students and Teachers. A student creates a class (course) that he will teach for the semester and  the student in turn joins the classes he/she would prefer to join.  Depending on when the teacher decides to take attendance, he logs into the system and then starts mentioning the names of students who have registered for his courses. This in turn allows for familiarity and makes teachers know their students by names.
The system also provides analytic features for both kind of users to see their track record like number of days present or absent.
